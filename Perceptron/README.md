# Machine-Learning-DaisyQuach
 
This is a machine learning library developed by Daisy Quach for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah.

In this "Perceptron" folder, there should be code that implements three types of perceptron: standard, voted, and average.

For "HW3_StandardPerceptron", the results will vary as the code was written to shuffle to data each time it runs. The output is dependent on the shuffle.

For "HW3_VotedPerceptron" and "HW3_Average Perceptron", the results are consistent each time it is ran (as it does not need to shuffle the data). Keep in mind that the voted perceptron will output several weights for the algorithm as opposed to the single weight develooped by the voted perceptron.
