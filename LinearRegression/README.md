# Machine-Learning-DaisyQuach
 
This is a machine learning library developed by Daisy Quach for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah.

In this "Linear Regression" folder, there should be code that implements Adaboost, bagging, and random forest.

In "HW2_BatchGradientDescent", the batch gradient descent algorithm was implemented. In the script, you can alter parameters (w_0, error threshold, max iterations, and learning rate r).The code will run and output the learned weights and plot the cost values as a function of iterations.
