# Machine-Learning-DaisyQuach
 
This is a machine learning library developed by Daisy Quach for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah.

In this "DecisionTree" folder, there is python code that inputs data (i.e. bank and car data), and outputs a decision tree using the ID3 algorithm.

In HW1_ID3Algorithm_CarData, a generic ID3 algorithm was implemented to support information gain, majority error, gini index, and maximum tree depths.

In HW1_ID3Algorithm_BankData_partA, the ID3 algorithm was altered to interpret "unknown" attributes as an attribute.

In HW1_ID3Algorithm_BankData_partB, the ID3 algorithm was altered to interpret "unknown" attributes as missing values. 

For all python files, parameters (e.g. maxTreeDepth and bestAttributeMethod) can be altered within the script. Running the code, the decision tree will be output into the variable explorer under the name "decisionTree" as a defined class type "Node".
