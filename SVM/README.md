# Machine-Learning-DaisyQuach
 
This is a machine learning library developed by Daisy Quach for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah.

In this "SVM" folder, there should be code that implements the sub-gradient descent SVM, dual SVM, and the extra credit gaussian kernal perceptron. 

Some algorithm results will vary as the code was written to shuffle to data each time it runs. The output is dependent on the shuffle.

Adjusting parameters and hyperparameters can be directly altered within the script (all files are formatted similarly).
